          <!-- About the Project -->
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              Building a personal portfolio is something every web developer
              eventually does â€” whether to showcase skills, land a job, or
              document personal growth. For me, it was all three. I wanted to
              sharpen my frontend development abilities, make my work visible
              to potential clients or employers, and create a space where I
              could present my projects with full creative freedom.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              But rather than use a template or website builder, I challenged
              myself to build everything from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. It was a bold move, especially since I didnâ€™t have a
              clear vision in the beginning. Still, thatâ€™s where the real
              learning began.
            </p>

          <!-- Starting from zero -->
          <h3 class="intro-hi">Starting from zero</h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              The most difficult part of the entire process was simply starting.
              With no pre-made structure or component libraries to rely on, I
              had to figure out everything â€” layout, color palette, page flow,
              responsive behavior â€” step by step. At first, I didnâ€™t know
              exactly what I wanted the site to look like or how it would
              function, but small progress each day eventually shaped the
              direction.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              I began with the basics: setting up the HTML structure, planning
              the sections, and ensuring semantic clarity. My navigation bar
              includes links to About, Projects, Blog, and Contact. Each of
              these also exists as a scrollable section on the homepage, but
              individual pages were created for each project and blog post as
              well. This dual structure gives users the flexibility to explore
              the content their way.
            </p>

          <!-- Design and Functionality -->
          <h3 class="intro-hi">Design and Functionality</h3>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              Design quickly became my favorite part of the process. Since I had
              full control, I was able to experiment with layouts, spacing,
              typography, and animations until everything felt right. I kept the
              visual identity clean and minimal but added personality through
              motion and color themes.
            </p>
            <div class="">
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                The site features:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A fully functional dark mode toggle
                </li>
                <li>
                  Subtle animations to bring components to life
                </li>
                <li>
                  Responsive design that works smoothly across devices
                </li>
                <li>
                  A custom loading screen that enhances the experience before
                  the site is ready
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              Implementing these features wasnâ€™t always smooth. One of the
              biggest technical hurdles was making sure the dark mode and
              loading screen worked harmoniously. At one point, toggling
              between themes would interfere with the load animation or vice
              versa. Debugging and restructuring the JavaScript helped solve
              this, and I gained a better understanding of script timing and
              state management.
            </p>

          <!-- What I learned -->
          <h3 class="intro-hi">What I learned</h3>
          <div class="tech-content">
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              Throughout the journey, I learned far more than just how to make
              a website look nice. Some of the key takeaways include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Structuring HTML more efficiently, keeping it semantic and
                scalable
              </li>
              <li>
                Writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS, with better use of
                layout systems like Flexbox and media queries
              </li>
              <li>
                Managing JavaScript logic for interactive UI, including theme
                persistence and event-based DOM updates
              </li>
              <li>
                The importance of design consistency and user flow,
                especially when the site grows in content
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              More than anything, I developed the discipline to build a full
              project from scratch, overcome technicalobstacles, and polish
              every detail until it felt truly mine.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Final Thoughts -->
          <h3 class="intro-hi">Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            If thereâ€™s one piece of advice I can offer to anyone looking to
            create their own portfolio: donâ€™t wait until you feel ready. I
            wasnâ€™t. I started with little direction, but I knew that each line
            of code would teach me something â€” and it did. Now, I have a
            portfolio that Iâ€™m proud of, not just because of how it looks or
            what it does, but because I built every part of it myself.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            The website is now live on GitHub Pages, and it represents not only
            my work but also my growth as a developer.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            Thanks for reading â€” and if youâ€™re in the middle of building your
            own project, keep going. The best way to learn is to start.
